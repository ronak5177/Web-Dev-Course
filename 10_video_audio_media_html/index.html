    <div>The "preload" attribute can have the following values:</div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        none: This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should
        not preload the audio file at all. The audio file will only start
        downloading when the user initiates playback.
      </li>
      <li>
        metadata: This value tells the browser to preload only the metadata of
        the audio file, such as its duration and basic information about the
        audio. This can be useful if you want to display the audio duration to
        the user without fully loading the audio data.
      </li>
      <li>
        auto: This value instructs the browser to preload the entire audio file
        as much as possible without delaying the loading of other important page
        content. The browser will try to load the audio file in the background
        so that it's ready to play when the user decides to start it.
      </li>
    </ol>
